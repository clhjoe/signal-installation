## Steps for Compile and Run Signal Server

0. Clone this project to make thing happen

```
git clone https://github.com/clhjoe/signal-installation.git
```

1. Run related services
   
Signal server relies on AWS SQS, AWS S3, Redis, and Postgresql. Thanks to container and localstack, we can setup on our local site easily.

```
# start redis, postgresql, and Localstack services
make start-env

# create SQS queue and S3 bucket
make init-env
```

2. Download Signal Server project, compile, and generates configs

```
make build
```

3. Start Signal Server

```
make start
```
